# AdaBots Editor

ABE is a ready-to-use editor inside a docker image, preconfigured for writing AdaBots programs.

# Setup

You need to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) first.
Next, we need to download [the launcher script](/bin/abe) and put it somewhere in your PATH.

```
TODO put some wget instructions here
```

# Use

To use, open a terminal and run abe, optionally passing an existing program text file to open:

```
abe yourprogram.adb
```
